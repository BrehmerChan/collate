#High Priority
* A user can demarcate the lines of code that he wrote
* A user can select the folder that contains the source files of the project he wants to collate
* A user can specify if subfolders should be recursively scanned for source files
* A user can specify which types of files to be collated
* A user can view the total proportion of code each person wrote so that he can find out the overall contribution of the people involved
* A user can view the contributions of each contributor in a single file so that he knows exactly which part of the code each person wrote

#Medium Priority
* A user can exclude files so that these files will not be collated
* A user can view the proportion of code each person wrote for each file
* A user can view the individual statistics of each contributor
* A user can load a previous set of contribution statistics so that he can see past contributions to the project

#Low Priority
* A user can change the default save directory of the contribution statistics
* An advanced user can add new definitions for new types of files so that he can customise the keywords to demarcate contributors' code
* A user can see the current definitions for each type of file so that he can find out how each file should be correctly formatted
